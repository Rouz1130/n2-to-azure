<p>Recommended for use in more than 1,800 applications by more than 500 major equipment builders, Mobil SHC 600 Series synthetic lubricants continue to be recognized by OEMs addressing specific lubrication challenges while maintaining excellent overall performance.</p>
<p>Mobil SHC 600 Series synthetic lubricants can reduce energy consumption in gearboxes and circulating systems by up to 3.6 percent*. They can also:</p>
<ul>
<li>Extend oil life by up to six times vs. conventional</li>
<li>Offer similar seal and metals compatibility as mineral oils</li>
<li>Operate in a wide range of IND applications</li>
</ul>
<p><i>*The energy efficiency design is a trademark of Exxon Mobil Corporation. Energy efficiency relates solely to the fluid performance when compared to conventional (mineral) reference oils of the same viscosity grade in circulating and gear applications.
The technology used allows up to 3.6 percent efficiency compared with the reference when tested in a worm gearbox under controlled conditions. Efficiency improvements will vary based on operating conditions and applications.</i></p>]]>
